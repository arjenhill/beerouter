ðŸ¦‹ Bee router is a small and exquisite React Router for mobile web project, with only 200 lines of code. Different with react-routerï¼Œbee router has the following advantages:

- Over ten times smaller volume, which makes it is suitable for mobile web projects with limit of code lines.
- Bee router has the same basic functions with react router, such as route switching and routing events etc. , but reducing rarely-used functions in react router.
- Unlike react router which repeatedly initializes components, bee-router only needs to be initialized once, which greatly saves resources.
